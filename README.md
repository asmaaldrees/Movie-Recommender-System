# Movie-Recommender-System

This project builds a movie-recommender system, i.e., system that recommends an item to a user based upon a description of the item and a profile of the userâ€™s interests. The dataset that is used in this project is movielens data from Grouplens research group. Similar movies are recommended according to previously constructed user preferences. This recommender system focuses on the collaboration filtering techniques, which take into account the user profiles beside their relationships with other users.
